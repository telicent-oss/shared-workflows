on:
  workflow_call:
    inputs:
      SCAN_NAME:
        type: string
        description: |
          A developer friendly name for the image to differentiate scan reports where a repository is
          building multiple images.
      IMAGE_REF:
        type: string
        description: |
          Specifies the full image reference (repository, name and tag) for an image you wish to scan.
        required: true
      PATH_TO_GRYPE_CONFIG_ONLY_FOR_BUILD_IMAGE:
        required: false
        type: string
        description: Path to custom grype yaml file. NEVER use .grype.yaml, must be non-default filename. Only allowed for BUILD image, MUST NOT be used with DEPLOY images.
      IMAGE_FROM_ARTIFACT:
        required: false
        default: false
        type: boolean
        description: |
          Scan a Docker image tar stored as an artifact (name must be ${SCAN_NAME}.tar), rather
          than an image stored in a remote repository
      REMOTE_VEX:
        required: false
        type: string
        description: |
          Supplies references to one/more repositories from which additional VEX statements should be obtained and used
          to filter out vulnerabilities that have been assessed as to not apply to our software products.

          Note that telicent-oss/telicent-base-images is always included by default so this is only needed if the image
          being built relies on other images/libraries for which VEX statements are required.
      SECURITY_ISSUES_BLOCK_ONLY_IF_FIX_AVAILABLE:
        required: false
        default: false
        type: boolean
